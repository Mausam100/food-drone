# Component Guidelines

## State Management
- Use React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for local component state
- Implement cleanup in `useEffect` hooks to prevent memory leaks
- Use refs (`useRef`) for values that shouldn't trigger re-renders

## Animation Standards
- Use GSAP with `useGSAP` hook for animations
- Follow the animation pattern in [src/components/Home/StartOverlay.jsx](mdc:src/components/Home/StartOverlay.jsx)
- Implement staggered animations for better UX

## Mobile & Responsive Design
- Always implement orientation checks for mobile devices
- Use media queries for responsive layouts
- Handle fullscreen mode appropriately
- Clear timeouts and event listeners in cleanup functions

## Code Organization
- Group related state variables together
- Place event handlers after state declarations
- Keep animation logic in separate `useGSAP` hooks
- Use semantic class names for animation targeting
